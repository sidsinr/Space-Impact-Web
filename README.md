# Space-Impact-Web
## Introduction
This project is the web version of Nokia 3310's classic game "Space Impact". A 2D shooter game, in which the player flies a spaceship and destroys incoming swarms of enemies spanning across 8 levels. Each level at the end has its own level boss. 

The objective of the game is to survive and beat the final boss. 

The player has unlimited ammo for the normal bullets. The player also gets one of the three types of different special attacks namely; homing missiles, laser gun and laser wall. These special attacks are limited and can only be replenished from the powerup picked up during a level. The powerup can also provide an extra life.

All the necessary information during the game is available at the top; which include the lives remaining, the type of special attack and the number of attacks remaining, and the score. 
There is also an option to pause the game during the gameplay.

The game is responsive and can be played on a mobile browser. I've added onscreen buttons that can be toggled on/off.

## How to run
Being a complete front-end application, the game can be run on any web broswer.

Check out the live game here: https://sidsinr.github.io/Space-Impact-Web/

Or, download the files and run the **index.html** file in any of the browser. Just make sure the file paths remains the same.

## Software Tools Used
- Adobe Photoshop, to create all the game assets.
- HTML, for laying the foundation of the application.
- CSS, for styling the components of the html document and making it responsive.
- Vanilla JS, for the entire game build.

### Acknowledgement
[OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org) for the onscreen buttons.

## Future Plans
1. Addition of sound effects. Currently the game has no audio.
2. A leaderboard for storing the high-scores.
3. A more modern looking colorful art for the game, but preserving the originality of the game. Adding the parallax scrolling to the background for creating an effect of depth.
